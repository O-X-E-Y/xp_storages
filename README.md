Just a little datapack that adds xp storages to the game through structure blocks.

## How to use:

Recipe:

![Crafting recipe](https://github.com/O-X-E-Y/xp_storages/blob/main/storage_recipe.jpg)

-Throw the XP Storage on the ground to place it.

-To activate it, stand on top of it. This will link the storage to you.

-To store xp, crouch while on top.

-To extract xp, crouch on top while holding a glass bottle.

-To remove it, throw an emerald on top of it. If the storage was activated, this will consume the emerald.

-The storages are bound to player IDs. This means you can't extract xp from or remove other player's storages.

-To give other players the storage without it activating, look at their eyes while standing within 6 blocks away.

You might lose one xp occasionally. I want to assure you that this is not a bug, it's a feature! :)
If you find any other bugs, be sure to let me know.
Have fun with these :)
